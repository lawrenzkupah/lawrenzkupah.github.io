Im going to start trying to keep a monthly going update of my 
life happenings both for myself and friends. These will likely 
include things im doing, reading, thinking, etc

Travels
I went to Cyprus (the southern part) over reading week! which, all things considered was a little disapointing
It was still nice to go however, to embark five hour flight (both ways) 
only to find that London weather was contemperaneously nicer was a bit of 
a let down. That being said it was still a nice break from school and life. 
Went with some school friends which was a good bonding excercise I find... so 
now they're stuck with me for life. With regards to Cyprus I found the food to be
nothing special however the ocean is pretty and I got to see some old shit
like, 2000 year old shit. I presume im supposed to be interested in this stuff as I study
history? Ultimately I have come away from the experience with an image in by head of
it being 'british' Disney Land.

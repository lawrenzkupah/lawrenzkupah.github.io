    <div id = "summary">Depression is expensive to all nations in the world. How the causes of depression are understood is constantly evolving. This paper looks at socioeconomic
        contributors to depression with care for current understandings of the problem
        along with recent data. Previous understandings of an inverse relationship between income and depression are bolstered here along with other mental health
        symptoms. The analysis is conducted with an ordinal logistic regression model
        assuming proportional odds, implemented in this regression are two unique instruments for personal and family income. The results in this paper are relevant
        to public policy professionals who aim to minimize depression’s cost to their society. Repository attached below

    <a href = "Documents/finalAIresults.pdf" target = "_blank" id = "item"> Exchange Rate Forecasting</a>
    <div id = "summary"> This project aimed to forecast various exchange rates utilizing a RNN with the Keras library. Of note is the ability 
        of the model to forecast exchange rates more effectively than index funds such as the S&P 500. Code for this project can be seen on my github.

    <div id = "summary">
        With recent advances in AI -- specifically deep fake creations -- it becomes crucial for our socities 
        to be able to identify the use of deep fakes. This project approaches this problem by exploring differing methodologies
        to detect deep fakes. This was a group project which I did during my time at LSE

    <a href = "" target = "_blank" id = "item"> State-Central Bank Relations in Early Modern
        Britain</a>
    <div id = "summary">
        Following the Glorious Revolution, William Patterson founded the Bank of Eng-
        land. Originally, it was created to help England fund a costly war with France. De-
        spite its humble origin, this bank would go on to become the most important in
        the world through the late 19th century. In its evolution from a bank to the ’bank
        of banks’, it was soon discovered that the institutional framework on which it was
        built and existed made it at the mercy of the state, and vice versa. Crucially, there
        existed the institutional capacity for central bank coercion. Substantiating local
        projection techniques with historical narrative, this paper ascertains whether and,
        if so, how this control may have been used, adding insights into why it was restruc-
        tured 150 years after its initial establishment

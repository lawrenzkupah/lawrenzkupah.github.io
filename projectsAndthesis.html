    <a href="Documents/Thesisltx.pdf" target="_blank" id = "item">Income Causalities of Depression</a>
    <div id = "summary">Depression is expensive to all nations in the world. How the causes of depression are understood is constantly evolving. This paper looks at socioeconomic
        contributors to depression with care for current understandings of the problem
        along with recent data. Previous understandings of an inverse relationship between income and depression are bolstered here along with other mental health
        symptoms. The analysis is conducted with an ordinal logistic regression model
        assuming proportional odds, implemented in this regression are two unique instruments for personal and family income. The results in this paper are relevant
        to public policy professionals who aim to minimize depressionâ€™s cost to their society.</div>

    <a href = "Documents/finalAIresults.pdf" target = "_blank" id = "item"> Exchange Rate Forecasting</a>
    <div id = "summary"> This project aimed to forecast various exchange rates utilizing a RNN with the Keras library. Of note is the ability 
        of the model to forecast exchange rates more effectively than index funds such as the S&P 500. Code for this project can be seen on my github.

    <div id = "summary">
        With recent advances in AI -- specifically deep fake creations -- it becomes crucial for our socities 
        to be able to identify the use of deep fakes. This project approaches this problem by exploring differing methodologies
        to detect deep fakes. This was a group project which I did during my time at LSE
